					This Saturday, January 12 marks the opening of North County’s first cat cafe, and just the second in the San
					Diego area. Founded by Caroline and Andrew Vaught, Cat & Craft brings together the couple’s love for cats and
					their passion for craft coffee; the Vista-based venue combines a 1,500-square-foot cafe with an
					800-square-foot
					cage-free lounge space for adoptable cats and kittens.

					Separated from the cat area by a glass wall, the cafe will feature coffee from Rancho Bernado’s Manzanita
					Roasting Company in everything from espresso drinks to single-origin pour-overs and housemade cold brew. The
					daytime menu includes avocado toast and seasonal fruit toast with lemon mascarpone made with bread from Bread
					&
					Cie and pastries and desserts provided by local companies A Delight of France and Hazel and Jade, a vegan
					bakery.

					The foster cats are from North County 501c3 Love Your Feral Friends (LYFF) and are fully vaccinated,
					spayed/neutered and microchipped; all of the adoption fees will go to supporting the non profit. Visiting the
					<mark>cat lounge costs $12 per hour</mark>, and reservations are recommended; children over seven are allowed
					if accompanied
					by a parent or legal guardian.

				<h3>First Day:</h3>
				<p>
					Now, you are ready for your cat’s homecoming. Preferably, bring her home in a cat carrier. It will feel safer
					to her. She has seen a lot of excitement, so take her directly to her new room. (Make sure the toilet lid is
					down, if she’s to acclimate in your bathroom.) Ideally, you would restrict her exposure to the whole family,
					but naturally, everyone is going to want to see her. Remind them of the ground rules you’ve set up.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sit on the floor and let her come to you. Don’t force her. Just let her get acquainted on her own time. If
						she doesn’t approach, leave her alone and try again later. Some cats are particularly frightened, and she
						may retreat to her hidey hole and not come out when you’re around at all. She may only come out at night
						when the house is quiet. Give her time.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your newly adopted cat may not eat much or at all at first. It’s best to give your cat the same food she had
						at the shelter or in her foster home, at least at first. Keeping some things familiar will make her feel
						more secure. Be sure to change her water frequently and make sure that she is drinking. If your cat hasn’t
						eaten for a few days, call your vet to ask for advice.
					</li>
				</ul>
